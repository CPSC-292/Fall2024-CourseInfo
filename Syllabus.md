### About the Course

This course operates on a labor-based and mastery-based grading system, meaning that:

 - your labor and participation in course materials determines the grade you receive; and
 - the completion of work will directly indicate your level of mastery with the material.

### How Student Work is Assessed (Labor-based System)

All work is scored on a three-tiered scale: 

 - completed and satisfactory (score of 1), 
 - completed and unsatisfactory (score of 0), or 
 - not completed (score of 0). 

If an item does not reach a satisfactory level, you will have the opportunity to revise it after receiving instructor feedback and/or peers to move it up to the completed and satisfactory level. All assignments may be submitted up to three times in total for scoring, although each attempt must be made within three business days of receiving comments back from instructors. (For example, if you receive feedback on a Monday, you must submit another attempt by end-of-day on Thursday of that week. If you received feedback on a Thursday, you must submit another attempt by end-of-day on Tuesday of the following week.)

### Types of Work (Mastery-based System)

There are three types of work, completion of each indicates level of mastery of the material. In this class, these will be: 

 - __Assignments__: completion indicates _basic competence_ of the learning objective(s) being assessed. (This will be C-level work.) There will be approximately 28 assignments during the semester.
 - __Skill Checks__: completion indicates _advanced competence_ of the learning objective(s) being assessed. Typically, this will involve more synthesis of concepts and independence than assignments to complete. (This is B-level work.) There will be 6 Skill Checks during the semester. 
 - __Projects__: completion indicates _mastery_ of the learning objectives(s) being assessed. Projects will involve not only synthesis of a broad range of concepts, but also creativity, independence, and originality of work. (This is A-level work.)  There will be 3 projects during the semester.

As such, completing these assignments will indicate your level of mastery in the material covered in the course. 

__Final Course Grade__ | Projects completed (A-level) | Skill Checks completed (B-level) | Assignments completed (C-level) |
| :-----------------: | :------------------: | :--------------: | :----------------: |
|         A         |        3           |       6        |       100 %      |
|         B         |        1           |       6        |       100 %      | 
|         C         |        0           |       2        |       100 %      | 
|       D or F      |        0           |      >2        |      < 90 %      |


Failure to complete 100% of assignments will result in some Skill Checks or Projects being converted into assignments. This rate is 1 project = 3 assignments; 1 skill check = 2 assignments. If a skill check is missing, 1 project will be converted into a skill check. 

### About deadlines

There will be deadlines for completion of work typically one week after the material needed to complete the item's learning objective is covered in class and the item is assigned. After this deadline, items will be scored as not complete (0). There is no "late" work accepted.

However, life happens, and you may not want to discuss with your instructor exactly what is going on to catch a break. You are allowed to invoke the __Life-Happens Clause__ on any assignment item (except those during the final exam period), no excuse required. Simply request a new deadline by email or a Slack message within 48 hours of when item was due (either before or after the deadline). _You have to provide the new deadline in the message!_ You may invoke the clause as many times as needed during the semester. If it becomes habitual, consider contacting the instructor so we can work out a better timetable for submitting assignments. 

### Attendance and Participation

Learning depends on engagement, and engagement depends on both the relationship between students and instructors and the general learning environment. Engagement is a relationship, and like any other relationship, depends on two people: the instructor and the student. Instructors will do their part to come to class prepared with interesting material and a science-based lecture style that includes active learning techniques. You are expected to come to class prepared by completing any pre-class videos and assignments and willing to participate in your own learning. Furthermore, you are expected to help cultivate a positive and welcoming learning environment for you and your fellow students. In order to do this, class attendance _and participation_ is mandatory throughout the semester. 

__How participation will be assessed__: Days in which you don't participate will be recorded. This could be due to: absence, excessive lateness (more than 10 minutes), not working on class exercises, not engaging with group work, not engaging in lecture materials, being excessively distracted or distracting (including being off-task on the computer or phone), not viewing lesson videos in a timely manner, etc. Since no one is perfect, three absences will be overlooked during the semester. Additional absences will lead to a loss in completed work at the rate of three absences resulting in a deduction of one completed assignment. 

__Link between Assignments and Videos:__ This class is partially flipped, so that you will need to watch a video of lecture content *before* attending the scheduled lecture in which that content will be covered. The lecture will consist of in-class work on the linked assignments. *In order for the associated assignment to be marked complete, the lecture video must be completed.* 

There are no make-up work except under extraordinary circumstances for which documentation exists or otherwise noted. Please attend class on time, defined as within 5 minutes of the class start time.

### Pluses and Minuses on Course Grades

Final cutoffs for pluses and minuses on course grades are at the instructor's discretion and will be determined at the end of the course. 

### Other Course Policies

__Generative Artificial Intelligence Tools__: Generative AI (GenAI) tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Dall-e, Copilot) can offer useful information and are becoming more prevalent inside and outside of professional spaces. GenAI info can be (and often is) inaccurate and incomplete. Students in this course are responsible for the accuracy and authenticity of the material that is submitted on assignments and how to use information provided by GenAI in an ethical and responsible way. 

The use of GenAI is permitted in this course for the following activities: 

 - brainstorming or refining ideas, 
 - fine-tuning visualization questions, 
 - finding general information about a topic, 
 - draft an outline to organize thoughts, 
 - checking grammar, 
 - writing conventions and style, and 
 - debugging and explaining code. 
 
The use of GenAI is not permitted for the following activities: 

 - writing a draft of a writing assignment, 
 - writing complete code or blocks of code for use in assignments, data analysis or visualization, or 
 - writing entire sentences, paragraphs, or papers to complete class assignments. 
 
Students are responsible for fact-checking all GenAI output and disclosing the use and nature of use of GenAI tools on all class work.

__COVID__: Masks are not required in class or office hours, but you are free to wear one if you wish. Any student required to quarantine or isolate due to exposure to or infection with SARS-CoV-2 will be able to attend classes remotely when possible. I am happy to work with you regarding making up class work.

__Final Project Policy:__ You must participate in and pass the final project in order to pass the course. _There will be no exceptions to this policy._ If you are aiming for C-level work, you must attend the final exam period where projects are presented (even if you don't otherwise contribute). 

__Electronic Devices__ (phones, computers, etc): Please refrain from inappropriate usage of electronic devices during class. The instructor reserves the right to ask you to discontinue the use of any electronic device which becomes a significant distraction to your classmates or me. Switch cell phones to silent/vibrate. You may make audio recordings of the lectures for personal use, but do not share them with others or post them publicly without the instructor's written permission.  

__Group Work__: Group work is encouraged on all assignments and during class, except those explicitly stated to be _individual evaluations_. You are free to assume that an assignment is meant to be worked on together unless otherwise directed. If you work in groups on an assignment, simply list the members of your group on the top of the assignment. 

__Communications__: Please use a direct message on Slack rather than email. You can expect replies to emails and slacks within regular working hours (9 am to 5 pm, M-F). I will try my best to respond within one working day. Please check the syllabus before asking a question about the course. Detailed questions are best asked during office hours, you will get a better and more thorough answer. If your question takes more than 3 mins to respond to, you will be asked to come to office hours. Please treat email as formal communication; if you are unsure of how to properly format an email to your professor, please ask. Slack is far more informal; memes, tiktoks, etc. are encouraged.
