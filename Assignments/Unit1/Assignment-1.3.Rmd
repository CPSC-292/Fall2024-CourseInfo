## Assignment 1.3 -- Create a Course Directory


Create a directory using your file system manager GUI for all the material you’ll use in the course. Take a screen shot of the directory. Determine the absolute file path for this directory (from the root directory to the new CPSC directory), and annotate the screen shot with the path. Upload the annotated screen shot.
