## Example CO2 plot

Plotting monthly *in-situ* carbon dioxide concentrations measured at the Mauna Loa station 1958-2019.

Read and clean the data: 

```{r}
co2_dat <- read.csv("monthly_in_situ_co2_mlo.csv", skip=56, header=TRUE) # loads the data from CSV file
# assigns new names for columns 
colnames(co2_dat) <- c("year","mn","date_excel","date",
                       "seasonal_co2","seasonal_adj_co2",
                       "seasonal_fit_co2","seasonal_fit_adj_co2",
                       "seasonal_filled_co2","seasonal_filled_adj_co2") 

# Clean out data points that are negative 
co2_dat <- co2_dat[sign(co2_dat$seasonal_co2) != -1,]
```

Make a plot of CO2 values in August of every year:

```{r}
plot(x = co2_dat$year, y = co2_dat$seasonal_adj_co2, 
     type = "l", xlab = "Year", ylab = "CO2 (ppm)")
```
